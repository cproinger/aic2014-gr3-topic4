* extract more infos for relationships such as 'repliedTo', 'retweeted', so that
  the relevant topic is included as attribute
* currently, new users, which may be found while mining user to user
  relationships, are persisted only in neo4j with their id. For such users, the
  metadata has to be then separately loaded in the sql db.
* new relationship: user -> tweet source (url from where the tweet is sent)

* better topic extraction: place's names
